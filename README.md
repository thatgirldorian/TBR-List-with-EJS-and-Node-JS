# TBR List with EJS and Node JS
 This is a list app that lets me keep track of the books I want to read per month. I created it with EJS, Node JS and some pre-made CSS.

<h3>Issues faced and Solutions:</h3>
I struggled with using a gradient for this project at first. Themn while looking at YouTube tutorials, I realised I could use animations instead.
Since I have never used animation sin my projects before, I had to learn how to animate blobs and was able to add a couple neat ones to my website. I used the blob maker at blobmaker.app and a great animation article from CSS Tricks.
